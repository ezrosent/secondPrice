secondPrice
===========

Basic experiments with agent-based simulation of second-price auctions in D.

Most of this is intended as an exercise in my learning specific features
in the D programming language, but I would like to verify that these
results match the paper where this is from:``A Study on Internet Auctions Using
Agent Based Modeling Approach'' by Akkaya et.\ al.\
